# DermAnki

This repository contains an anki deck for common derm conditions taught in the 
Feinberg School of Medicine dermatology module. The original images were compiled by
Ali Khan [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZkEMD-iKqb41mLeccJn6jJJBnBFxemGB?usp=sharing).

Code here can be used for quickly generating anki decks using images as the question stems.
